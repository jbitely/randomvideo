Hack Reactor Remote Prep - Group Hackathon Project

A user searches for a musical artist and song title. The SoundCloud api is queried to play the track while the Musixmatch api is queried for the lyrics. The lyrics are broken down by line and from each line two random words are used to query the Giphy api for a random gif. The gifs are displayed as the song plays.

API's used:
SoundCloud
Musixmatch
Giphy

Pure CSS used for styling.
